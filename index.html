<h3>What is journey of life? And what do we need to begin our journey during our life?</h3>

<p>Life is a journey filled with lessons, hardships, heartaches, joys, celebrations and special moments that will ultimately lead us to our destination, our purpose in life. The road will not always be smooth; in fact, throughout our travels, we will encounter many challenges. Some of these challenges will test our courage, strengths, weaknesses, and faith. Along the way, we may stumble upon obstacles that will come between the paths that we are destined to take. In order to follow the right path, we must overcome these obstacles. Sometimes these obstacles are really blessings in disguise, only we don't realize that at the time.

	Along our journey we will be confronted with many situations, some will be filled with joy, and some will be filled with heartache. How we react to what we are faced with determines what kind of outcome the rest of our journey through life will be like.

<h2>Health and Beauty Tips (What should we do to stay healthy?)</h2>
<p>Your healthy behaviors can go a long way toward improving your health and lowering your risk of many cancers as well as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis. And they're not as complicated as you might think.
	So take control of your health, and encourage your family to do the same. you have to Choose one or two of the behaviors below to start with. Once you've got those done, move on to the others.</p>
<ol>
  <li><h4>Maintain a Healthy Weight.</h4></li>
  <p>Keeping your weight in check is often easier said than done, but a few simple tips can help. 
     First off, if you're overweight, focus initially on not gaining any more weight. 
     This by itself can improve your health. Then, when you're ready, try to take off some extra pounds for an even greater health boost.
  </p>
  <h4>TIPS</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Integrate physical activity and movement into your life.</li>
  <li>Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.</li>
  <li>Choose smaller portions and eat more slowly.</li>
  <li>Encourage activity during free time.</li>
  </ul>
<hr>
  <li><h4>Exercise Regularly</h4></li>
  <p>Few things are as good for you as regular physical activity. While it can be hard to find the time, it's important to fit in at least 30 minutes of activity every day. 
  More is even better, but any amount is better than none.</p>
  <h4>TIPS</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Choose activities you enjoy. Many things count as exercise, including walking, gardening and dancing.</li>
  <li>Make exercise a habit by setting aside the same time for it each day. Try going to the gym at lunchtime or taking a walk regularly after dinner.</li>
  <li>Play active games with your kids regularly and go on family walks and bike rides when the weather allows.</li>
  <li>Encourage children to play outside (when it's safe) and to take part in organized activities, including soccer, gymnastics and dancing.</li>
  </ul>
<hr>
<li><h4>Protect Yourself From Sexually Transmitted Infections</li></h4>
  <p>Among other problems, sexually transmitted infections, like human papillomavirus (HPV), are linked to a number of different cancers. 
  Protecting yourself from these infections can lower your risk.</p>
  <h4>TIPS</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Aside from not having sex, the best protection is to be in a committed, monogamous relationship with someone who does not have a sexually transmitted infection.</li>
  <li>For all other situations, be sure to always use a condom and follow other safe-sex practices.</li>
  <li>Never rely on your partner to have a condom. Always be prepared.</li>
  <li>When appropriate, discuss with children the importance of abstinence and safe sex. A health-care professional or school counselor can help.</li>
  </ul>
 <hr>
<li><h4>Get Screening Tests.</li></h4>
  <p>There are a number of important screening tests that can help protect against cancer. Some of these tests find cancer early when they are most treatable, while others can actually help keep cancer from developing in the first place. 
  For colorectal cancer alone, regular screening could save over 30,000 lives each year. That's three times the number of people killed by drunk drivers in the United States in all of 2011. 
  Talk to a health care professional about which tests you should have and when.</p>
  <h4>Cancers that should be tested for regularly:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Colon and rectal cancer</li>
  <li>Breast cancer</li>
  <li>Cervical cancer</li>
  <li>Lung cancer (in current or past heavy smokers)</li>
  </ul>
 </ol>
