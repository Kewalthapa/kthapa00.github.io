      <h2>What Is a Smartwatch?</h2>
      <p>A smartwatch is a portable device that's designed to be worn on a wrist. Smartwatches like smartphones- use touchscreens, offer apps, and often record your heart rate and other vital signs.
	The Apple Watch and Wear OS (formerly Android Wear) models prompted more consumers to appreciate the usefulness of wearing a mini computer on their wrists. 
	In addition, specialty smartwatches for outdoor activities often supplement other, bulkier devices in an adventurer's tool kit.</p>
