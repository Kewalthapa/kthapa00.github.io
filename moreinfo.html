      <h2>Types of Smartwatches</h2>
	<p>Broadly speaking, smartwatches occupy two niches in the wearables market. First, a general-purpose smartwatch - like the Apple Watch and most Google-powered Wear OS devices - blend form and function. They're designed to replace mechanical wristwatches and are heavily smartphone-dependent. Think of them as a support device for your phone that you happen to keep on your wrist. </p>
	<p>You'll see vendor-specific classes of general-purpose smartwatches in the consumer market:
	Apple Watch: Designed and sold by Apple
	Wear OS watches: Designed and sold by many vendors, using Google's Wear OS operating system
	Tizen watches: Proprietary operating system designed by Samsung for its popular Galaxy line of smartwatches
	The other niche includes specialty devices intended for specific-use cases. These devices often offer a more robust version of a fitness tracker, insofar as they bleed between a phone-dependent smartwatch and a stand-alone fitness tracker like a Fitbit.</p>
	<p>Examples of these specialized devices include:
	Hiking watches: Intended for remote travel and featuring solid battery life, GPS tracking and navigation, basic vitals, and weather forecasting. Often engineered for advanced durability to protect against bumps, drops, dust, and water. Examples include the Garmin Fenix 5 Plus, the Suunto 9 Baro, and the TomTom Adventurer.
	Diving watches: Connect your first-stage regulator to a Bluetooth transmitter to use a diving watch. Garmin's Descent Mk1 and Suunto's DX offer depth, time-remaining, temperature, and other important indicators.
	Flying watches: A niche market, but Garmin's D2 Delta PX offers on-wrist pulse Ox, a logbook, a GPS-powered moving map, and NEXRAD weather.</p>
	    <h3>How Many Types of Smartwatches Are There?</h3>
	    <p>It’s difficult to pinpoint how many different types of smartwatches there are exactly. That’s because the market is always changing and companies are always trying to one-up each other.
	    It seems like every device that hits the market has something new to offer. To make it easier, we’re going to separate watches into three different categories.</p>
	    <p>Those are:</p>

	<ul>
  		<li>The companion smartwatch</li>
  		<li>The standalone smartwatch</li>
  		<li>The classic smartwatch</li>
	</ul>  
	    
	    <p>The companion types of smartwatches need a tethered phone to work properly. But this means they can receive notifications and alerts, calls, and more. They tend to have better battery life because they don’t have to do the heavy lifting – the phone does.
		The standalone types of smartwatches operate without wireless limitations. They don’t need a phone to make calls, send SMS or browse the internet. Generally, this means they take a SIM card and connect to mobile networks – like a phone.</p>
	    <p>The classic types of smartwatches are a nothing more than a traditional watch with “smart” features. They often have a small display that shows notification icons for new messages or alerts. They need a connected smartphone too, but they have a limited set of features.</p>
	
	<h2>Special features.</h2>
	    <p>Additional features will vary from device to device, so you’ll want to think about how you’ll be using your smartwatch in your daily life. Here are some features to consider:</p>
	    <h4>Activity trackers.</h4>
	    <p>If you want a device that has health and fitness capabilities, look for a built-in pedometer (measures steps), accelerometer (measures intensity), heart rate monitor or other tracking technology. These features let you measure and track activity like steps taken, speed, calories burned and heart rate. Some smartwatches actually have their own, fully-integrated health experience that offer customized workouts or healthkits.</p>
	    <h4>Voice control</h4>
	    <p>Give voice commands, record memos, send and receive text messages, search the Web and much more, hands-free.</p>
	    <h4>Music</h4>
	    <p>Store music on your device’s internal memory for instant access to your media library.
	      Or, download an app that lets you access music stored on your smartphone.</p>
	    <h4>Link alarm</h4>
	    <p>Provides an audible or vibrating alert when you are out of wireless range.</p>
	    <h4>GPS</h4>
	    <p>Some smartwatches also come with GPS, so you can track and map your run, or just find your way around town.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>More Information about the smart watches</h2>
	<hr>
      <h3>What Is a Smartwatch?</h3>
	<p>A smartwatch is a portable device that's designed to be worn on a wrist. Smartwatches - like smartphones - use touchscreens, offer apps, and often record your heart rate and other vital signs.
	The Apple Watch and Wear OS (formerly Android Wear) models prompted more consumers to appreciate the usefulness of wearing a mini computer on their wrists. In addition, specialty smartwatches for outdoor activities often supplement other, bulkier devices in an adventurer's tool kit.</p>
	<h3>Short History of the Smartwatch</h3>
	<p>While digital watches have been around for decades - some with abilities like calculators and unit converters - only in the 2010s did tech companies begin releasing watches with smartphone-like abilities.
	Apple, Samsung, Sony, and other major players offer smartwatches on the consumer market, but a small startup actually deserves credit for popularizing the modern-day smartwatch. When Pebble announced its first smartwatch in 2013, it raised a record amount of funding on Kickstarter and went on to sell more than 1 million units.
	At the same time, advances in silicon miniaturization opened the door to other kinds of dedicated-purpose smartwatches. Companies like Garmin, for example, support smartwatches like the Fenix, which are more rugged and are optimized with sensors and trackers to support back-country expeditions. Likewise, companies like Suunto released smartwatches optimized for scuba diving that withstand extended time at significant depths.</p>
	<h3>What Do Smartwatches Do?</h3>
	<p>Most smartwatches - whether they're intended for daily use (as with the Apple Watch) or for specific purposes (as with the Garmin Fenix) - offer a suite of standard features:

	Notifications: Smartphones display notifications to alert you of important events or activities. The types of notifications differ; devices connected to a smartphone may simply mirror the phone's notifications on your wrist, but other smartwatches display notifications that only a wearable could provide. For example, the newest Apple Watch includes a fall sensor. If you fall while wearing the watch, the watch senses your subsequent movement; if it doesn't detect any, it'll send a series of escalating notifications. Fail to respond to the notification, and the watch will assume you're injured and alert authorities on your behalf.
	Apps: Beyond displaying notifications from your phone, a smartwatch is only as good as the apps it supports. App ecosystems vary, and they're tied to either Apple's or Google's environments. Smartwatches with a dedicated purpose, such as for hiking or diving, generally support the apps they need to accomplish that purpose without the opportunity to add other kinds of apps.
	Media management: Most smartwatches paired with smartphones can manage media playback for you. For example, when you're listening to music on an iPhone using Apple's AirPods, you can use your Apple Watch to change volume and tracks.
	Answer messages by voice: Remember the old Dick Tracy comics, where the hero detective used a watch as a phone? Modern smartwatches running either the watchOS or Wear OS operating systems support voice dictation.
	Fitness tracking: If you're a hard-core athlete, a dedicated fitness band is likely a better choice than a smartwatch. Still, many smartwatches include a heart rate monitor and a pedometer to help track your workouts.
	GPS: Most smartwatches include a GPS for tracking your location or receiving location-specific alerts.
	Good battery life: Modern smartwatches feature batteries that will get you through the day, with normal use, with a bit of juice still left to go. Battery use varies; the Apple Watch typically gets 18 hours of normal use on a single charge, while the Pebble gets two or three days.</p>
		
	<h3>What Types of Smartwatches Are Available?</h3>
	<p>There are a plethora of smartwatch variants. The purpose of each model has to do with the features and functionality offered by the device. For the most part, the design and visual style has nothing to do with what type of watch it is.<p>
	<p>For example, fitness trackers have so many different designs and form factors. What makes them similar is that they offer health and exercise tracking tools for on-the-go.</p>
	<p>Some smartwatches operate as a companion to your phone. You pair them via Bluetooth, and they deliver notifications and alerts to your wrist.</p>
	<p>Other types of smartwatches are standalone, so they can send and receive calls, send SMS and more, all without a tethered phone. Then, there are traditional watches that still include an analog clock face with a small display for notification icons. Before you can choose what types of smartwatches are right for you, you need to figure out what you want out of them.</p>
	
	<h3>Notifications.</h3>
	<p>Smartwatches are capable of displaying a variety of notifications like incoming calls, missed calls, text messages, e-mails, social media posts, appointment reminders,
	alarms  and much more.</p>
	<p>Many watches are fully customizable, allowing you to choose what notifications you receive, what’s displayed on the home screen, background picture, widgets and more.
	Do you want to receive a basic notification and view the rest of the content on your
	phone, or do you want to receive the full message on your smartwatch? Some devices
	will simply alert you of a notification with an icon, beep or vibration, while others can display the full message.</p>
	<p>Similar to Bluetooth headsets, a few smartwatches allow you to make and receive phone calls directly through your device rather than just receiving an alert (provided it’s within wireless range of your smartphone).</p>
